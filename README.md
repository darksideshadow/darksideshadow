## Hello, I'm Bryle!

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student pursuing a B.S in Computer Science and a B.A in Philosophy at San Diego State University.  

I'm currently interested in software development, computer systems, and game development. 

This is where I display my projects. Feel free to take a look around!
